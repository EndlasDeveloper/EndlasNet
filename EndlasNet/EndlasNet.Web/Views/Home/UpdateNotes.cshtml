           Changed work item start date and complete date to display date started and date completed in the UI. If dates aren't set,
           a NO ENTRY message appears where it used to be blank (this was making the UI look jankey).
        </li>
        <li>
            Moved all methods from IJobRepo and IWorkOrderRepo into IWorkRepo. Changed the job controller to use the IWorkRepo instead of the 
            previously used IJobRepo. This change will make it easier to selectively perform CRUD operations on any work entity
            (regardless of job or work order). Works as intended.

                    From LineItem, when the user clicks manage powders, the bottle powder name is correctly set. If the user
