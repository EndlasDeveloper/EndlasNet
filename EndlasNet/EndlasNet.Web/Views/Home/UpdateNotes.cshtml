            Fixed issue in parts for work order where the database calls weren't working in some cases.

            Increased database session duration to 2 hours.

            Added functionality to create multiple PowderForPart objects with a single user submit. User can
            now select a checkbox next to the parts the user wants to apply the entered weight to. The weight
            is correctly applied. Not sure if there is a check for zero on the view. If the user tries to enter
            too much weight, the user is redirected back to the create page with a warning.

        <li class="update-notes-li">
            Make PowderBottle -> Bottle number unique: This cannot be done with the way the app is currently working.
            Powder bottles need to be initialized by the user, but first must exist to do so. This creates the problem
            where multiple powder bottles have the same bottle number because they always start off as null.
            <br />
            I did, however, force the Endlas number for work to be unique at the database level. Then, a check was put
            in at the controller to ensure that the Endlas number is unique. If it isn't unique, the user is forwarded back
            the the create page with a warning message under the Endlas number form.

                Some delete views have a UI flaw with the delete button not fitting on one line with action links.

            <li class="update-notes-li">
                From LineItem, when the user clicks manage powders, the bottle powder name is correctly set. If the user
                navigates to a child view, and is forwarded back to index, the bottle powder name is no longer set.
