    <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">
        <li class="update-notes-li">
            Added description, composition, and pdf to static powder information. Added front-end UI elements for the new attributes in all views.
        </li>
        <li class="update-notes-li">
            On Edit Powder save -> fixed issue where the heading powder name would be lost after returning to the index view from views other than
            line items. Added powder order and line item reference in heading above powder name. Works for all cases of traffic into the page.
        </li>
        <li class="update-notes-li">
            LineItem -> Added Uninitialize line item in place of delete (remove delete option). On uninitialization, all existing children
            powder bottles are deleted. Added warining view to describe what else could be deleted when the item in interest is deleted.
        </li>
        <li class="update-notes-li">

            Under Actions -> default date is today's date. Fixed issue (in all edit views) where editing a db element that has a date time
            attribute would lose the previously entered date.
        </li>
        <li class="update-notes-li">
            MachiningTool -> Added InitToolCount column to back-end. On machining tool create. Only initial tool count is provided to the user.
