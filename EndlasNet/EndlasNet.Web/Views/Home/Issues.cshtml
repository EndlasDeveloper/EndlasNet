    <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Added FinishDrawing to StaticPartInfo.
            FinishDrawing is a pdf file that can save to the db, and the client can download the
            PDF to client device. Downloading is accessed under details for the part information.
            Under delete, Added extra row of data (Has pdf) to indicate whether the pdf is set for
            the part information to delete. Work -> Part information
        </li>

        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Added 'All Parts' action link, controller, and views for showing all parts. Work -> All parts
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Added sort asc-desc for suffix, and filter by work order or job only. Work -> All parts
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Implemented the same mechanics as PartForJob for PartForWorkOrder's views. Work -> Part for work order
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Fixed issue where on the dropdown for Job/WO in PartForJob/WO, the dropdown was showing work orders
            in addition the the jobs (and vice-versa). Work -> Job/Work order
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Under PowderOrders -> Manage LineItem -> Manage Powders, fixed the heading (not all the way) to display
            the powder name for quality of life.
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            In create MachiningToolForWork view, changed the dropdown for the machining
            tool from  &lt;vendor description&gt; to &lt;vendor description - purchase order number&gt;
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            LineItem -> Removed particle size. Added particle size minimum and particle size maximum (to define a range). Changed UI to
            show the range min-max where applicable.
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            PartForJob -> If the foreign key reference to StaticPartInfo already exists in another PartForJob, the suffix
            starts from where the last PartForJob suffix ended.
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            On creating a MachiningToolForWork, the referenced MachiningTool.ToolCount decrement still 0.
            There is a stop in place to prevent the tool count from reaching negative values. When the creation of a
            MachiningToolForWork results in a tool count < 0, the user is client if forwarded back to the create page
            with an indicator under the foreign key reference dropdown for machining tool (aka negative tool count is always prevented).
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Realized the list of machining tools in the dropdown could be filtered by tool count > 0 before rendering. Implemented this.
            Now, only tools with actual tools available are populated in the dropdown for machining tool.
        </li>
        <li class="patch-notes-li">
            Even though the list would only populate with tools with count > 0, it was left a little ambiguious why the list was empty.
            Added a check to indicate why the dropdown list is empty (appears immediately when create view is rendered).
        </li>
    </ul>

                Part count is wrong after adding 2 PartsForWork (they both display the 2nd count).

            <li class="patch-notes-li">
                Some delete views have a UI flaw with the delete button not fitting on one line with action links.

            <li class="patch-notes-li">
                From LineItem, when the user clicks manage powders, the bottle powder name is correctly set. If the user
                navigates to a child view, and is forwarded back to index, the bottle powder name is no longer set.
            </li>
            <li class="patch-notes-li">
                User isn't set for PowderOrders.

            <li class="patch-notes-li">
                When a static part info is created (it has a customer fk reference), and then the customer fk entry is deleted,
                an exception is thrown.
            </li>
            <li class="patch-notes-li">

            Put a '?' icon on all data access level views (any view that allows user to interact with the db in any way). When clicked,
