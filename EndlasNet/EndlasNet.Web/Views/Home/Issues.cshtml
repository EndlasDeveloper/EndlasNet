    <div>
        <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">

            <li>
                Want an 'All Parts' action link (similar to 'All powders') to show all parts. (worry about filtering later)
            </li>
            <li>
                Add FinishDrawing to StaticPartInfo. FinishDrawing is a pdf file that should be able to save to the db, and the user
                should be able to download the pdf to the client device.
            </li>
            <li>
                Work on powder for job (might be done because can edit powder weight already).
            </li>
            <li>
                In static part info, make the thumbnail open details of the static part info?
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement repository pattern for all entities and replace the direct context calls in the controllers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    @* ****** KNOWN ISSUES ****** *@
    <div style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Known issues</div>
    <div>
        <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">
            <li>
                When a static part info is created (it has a customer fk reference), and then the customer fk entry is deleted,
                an exception is thrown. Currently investigating.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some views do not have login protection implemented yet.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    @* ****** FINISHED TASKS ****** *@
    <div style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Finished tasks</div>
    <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">
        <li>
            Implemented the same mechanics as PartForJob for PartForWorkOrder's views.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed issue where on the dropdown for Job/WO in PartForJob/WO, the dropdown was showing work orders in addition the the jobs (and vice-versa).
        </li>
        <li>
            PowderOrders -> Manage LineItem -> Manage Powders -> Fixed the heading to display the powder name for quality of life.
        </li>
        <li>
            In create MachiningToolForWork view, changed the dropdown for the machining
            tool from  &lt;vendor description&gt; to &lt;vendor description - purchase order number&gt;
        </li>
        <li>
            LineItem -> Removed particle size. Added particle size minimum and particle size maximum (to define a range). Changed UI to
            show the range min-max where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
            PartForJob -> If the foreign key reference to StaticPartInfo already exists in another PartForJob, the suffix
            starts from where the last PartForJob suffix ended.
        </li>
        <li>
            On creating a MachiningToolForWork, the referenced MachiningTool.ToolCount decrement still 0.
            There is a stop in place to prevent the tool count from reaching negative values. When the creation of a
            MachiningToolForWork results in a tool count < 0, the user is client if forwarded back to the create page
            with an indicator under the foreign key reference dropdown for machining tool (aka negative tool count is always prevented).
        </li>
        <li>
            Realized the list of machining tools in the dropdown could be filtered by tool count > 0 before rendering. Implemented this.
            Now, only tools with actual tools available are populated in the dropdown for machining tool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even though the list would only populate with tools with count > 0, it was left a little ambiguious why the list was empty.
            Added a check to indicate why the dropdown list is empty (appears immediately when create view is rendered).
        </li>
    </ul>

    @* ****** OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ****** *@
    <div style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Other considerations</div>
    <ul style="font-size:14px;line-height:200%;">
        <li>
            Implement start suffix for part batch initialization?
        </li>
        <li>
            Put a '?' icon on all data access level views (any view that allows user to interact with the db in any way). When clicked,
            show a description of the view's purpose within the context of data access and work flow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Look at activity logging (or just logging) in ASP.NET EF Core.
        </li>
        <li>
            Look for a coded UI test library.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider paging and which views to implement paging with.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider search bar on views with many rows to filter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help tab development.
        </li>
    </ul>
